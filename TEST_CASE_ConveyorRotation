# Test Case ID: CB-LB-004
# Title: Multi-Conveyor Load Balancing With Box Counters

## Purpose
To verify that all four conveyor belts operate in balanced rotation without causing intersection traffic, using a 20–30 box counter per belt.

## Preconditions
- 4 conveyors active
- Sensors installed: B1_Sensor, B2_Sensor, B3_Sensor, B4_Sensor
- PLC logic loaded
- Intersection jam sensor active

---

## Test Steps

### Step 1 – All belts active
**Input:** Belt1=30, Belt2=25, Belt3=40, Belt4=30  
**Expected:** Each belt sends 20-30 boxes then hands over to next belt.

### Step 2 – Belt 2 empty
**Input:** B2 empty  
**Expected:** Belt 2 skipped

### Step 3 – Only one belt has boxes
**Expected:** That belt runs continuously (counter disabled)

### Step 4 – Belt becomes empty mid-cycle
**Expected:** Rotation moves to next belt automatically

### Step 5 – Intersection traffic simulation
**Expected:** No global stop triggered
